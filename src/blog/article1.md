descriptionShort: Environment Day Awareness Rally
descriptionLarge: "On the occasion of Environment Day, AMHSS Thirurkad, a school
  located in the heart of Thirurkad town, took the initiative to organize an
  awareness rally in the surrounding locality. The event witnessed an
  enthusiastic participation of both students and teachers, who came together
  with a shared goal: to spread the message of \"മണ്ണിലിറങ്ങാം, പച്ചവിരിക്കാം\"
  (Let's Embrace the Earth, Let's Go Green). The rally aimed to raise awareness
  about the importance of environmental conservation and sustainable practices.
  With colorful banners, placards, and vibrant energy, the students marched
  through the neighborhood, drawing the attention of the local community. The
  event served as a powerful reminder of our responsibility to protect and
  preserve our environment for future generations."
